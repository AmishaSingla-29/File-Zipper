# File_Zipper
In this project I have implemented a zipper. When we use software’s like WinZip or WinRAR we’re compressing our documents and files i.e lossless compression takes place. So with this project so that we can compress our documents and the compression will be completely lossless.  We choose a text file and when we click on Encode button, we get a Huffman tree. On right hand side we get the compression ratio. Higher the ratio, better the compression. It’s a simple compressor, not very advanced so we can compress simple text files using this project. We’ll also get the encoded text. When we upload the encoded file to it and click the Decode button, another file gets downloaded which is same as the original file we uploaded. Thus using this project, we can get the encoded file or decoded also without any loss.
